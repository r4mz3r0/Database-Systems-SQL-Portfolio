## User Stories 

- "As a operations leader I want to be able to view current and previous metrics all in one place so that I am able to view our progress" 
- As a control flow specialist I want a single place to report metrics so that I do not have to copy an excel sheet, update data, update and email" 
- (Example: Currently a control flow specialist must download the excel template, update the sheet, then email") We need a way to reduce the number of steps. 
- As an ARC I want all stakeholders to view our metrics so that I'm able to create presentations and complete my duties. 
- As a control flow specialist I want to document major obstructions so that the next shift can be aware of the challenges we faced. 
- As an ARC I want to know when and why we did not meet our goals (hog) so that I can prevent future obstructions.
